## Introduction
 - Phishing is sending fraudulent emails puporting to be a reputable company in order to induce individuals to reveal personal information such as credit card numbers or passwords
 - Phishing is a common cyber attack that has probably happened to a large portion of a developed population. The only way to defend yourself from the attack is to have knowledge of it.
 - This paper will explore what phishing is along with the technical workings of a phishing attack. Phishing attacks will be explored based on what could theoretically happen along with stories of successful and failed attacks.

 ## Background and Topic Prerequisites
 - There exists people who want to make money who do not care about ethics. Therefore, these people will exploit either systems or people in order to gain typically money or information. Phishing is simply another way of exploiting people
 - Email is a relatively recent invention therefore the term "phishing" was only coined back in 1996. AOL users were the victims of the first phishing attacks in 1995.
 - Phishing attacks are a form of social engineering which will be discussed briefly to frame the topic

 ## The Topic
 - The core idea is to educate the reader on what phishing attacks are and how they occur. This includes creating an email to mimic an organization or getting intelligence on a singular target or company.
 - People are defrauded on a daily basis by phishing scams that can be thwarted by showing potential victims what to look for
 - The people most interested in phishing attacks are the people who think they just got phished or are getting phished. Otherwise, it is just boring, sometimes mandatory work training.
 - Educating people about a common scam is a way to love thy neighbor. 

 ## Topic Implementation
 - Showing wildly successful phishing attacks is going to be the best implemented example available.
 - However, I will implement a mock phishing scam that could be used as a visual aide in a presentation. I will push a fake formatted email and a basic landing site to Github to show what a typical victim might experience. Furthermore, I will push either a markdown document or code that explains or gathers intel for potential targets. This will briefly go into open source intelligence. 
 - Since phishing is an illegal activity, the most current techniques probably are not going to be as readily available to learn/replicate as other technologies may be.

 ## Conclusions
 - What phishing is, how it works, and how to not be scammed
